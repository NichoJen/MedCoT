In cases of acute overdose, normal pathways of acetaminophen metabolism become saturated.

In this reference the DIC is most likely characterized by-,Significant numbers of schistocytes,A brisk reticulocytosis,Decreased coagulation factor levels,Significant thrombocytopenia,2,single,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Decreased coagulation factor levels DIC is characterized by excessive activation of the coagulation system. That leads to formation of microthrombi throughout the microcirculation of the body, often in a quixotically even distribution. o As a consequence of the thrombotic diathesis, there is consumption of platelets, fibrin and coagulation factors_and secondary activation of fibrinolytic mechanism. o Thus DIC can present with signs and symptoms relating to tissue hypoxia and infarction caused by the myriad microthrombi or as a hemorrhagic disorder related to depletion of elements required for homeostasis, hence the term consumption coagulopathy is used to describe D.I.C. o DIC can also lead to hemolytic anemia. It occurs due to fragmentation of red cells as they try to squeeze through the narrowed microvasculature. Schistocytes, the cells characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are quiet common in patients with D. I.0 (seen in 50%) of cause. o Like D.I.C., TT.P too, is characterized by widespread thrombosis and similar to D.I.C, the disseminated thrombosis leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. But the point to emphasize is that in TT.P the thrombus is a platelet thrombi i.e. the thrombi is composed mainly of platelets aggregates so quite unlike D.I.C. the level of coagulation factors remain normal. Robbins' States ""While D.I.C. and thrombotic microangiopathies share features such as microvascular occlusion and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, they are pathogenetically distinct. In T. and HUS (unlike DIC), activation of the coagulation cascade is not of primary impoant, and hence results of laboratory tests of coagulation such as PT and PTT are usually normal.""",Pathology,,1726,3

C: 3 weeks of wound healing When tissue is damaged, platelets adhere to exposed matrix integrins that bind to collagen and laminin. Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar. Wounds gain 20% of their ultimate strength in 3 weeks and later gain more strength, but they never reach more than about 70% of the strength of normal skin.",Pathology,,1008,3

She has experienced menorrhagia since menarche at age 13 years. On physical examination, there are no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies show hemoglobin, 14.1 g/dL; hematocrit, 42.5%; MCV, 90 mm3; platelet count, 277,400/ mm3; and WBC count, 5920/ mm3. Her platelets fail to aggregate in response to ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin. The ristocetin agglutination test result is normal. There is a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. Prothrombin time is 12 seconds, and partial thromboplastin time is 28 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Glanzmann thrombasthenia,Immune thrombocytopenic purpura,Vitamin C deficiency,1,single,"Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with defective platelet aggregation from deficiency or dysfunction of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa. The platelet aggregation studies described here are characteristic of this disorder. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in the consumption of all coagulation factors and platelets, so the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are elevated with thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX. Scurvy resulting from vitamin C deficiency causes bleeding into soft tissues and skin from increased capillary fragility, but platelet number and function are normal. Von Willebrand disease is one of the most common bleeding disorders and results from qualitative or quantitative defects in von Willebrand factor.",Pathology,Blood,865,3

The most likely diagnosis is -",Goodpasteur's syndrome,Classic polyarteritis nodosa,Wegener's granulomatosis,Kawasaki syndrome,2,single,"Renal and pulmonary symptoms with positive c-ANCA suggest the diagnosis of Wegener's glomerulonephritis (see above explanation).
The clinical syndrome of Wegener's granulomatosis may be very similar to classical PAN or microscopic polyangiitis.
Following facts will help you to differentiate Wegener's granulomatosis from other Two -

Wegener's granulomatosis Vs classical PAN

Wegener's granulomatosis involves small vessels (arteriole, venule, capillary), while PAN involves medium size vessels.
Wegener's granulomatosis is associated with c-ANCA, while classical PAN is not associated with ANCA.
In Wegener's granulomatosis there is lung involvement, but not in classical PAN.
In Wegener's granulomatosis, there is glomerulonephritis (hematuria) without hypertension, while in classical PAN there is hypertension without glomerulonephritis.
In Wegener's granulomatosis, there is granuloma formation, while it is absent in classical PAN.
Classical PAN shows microaneurysms which are absent in Wegener's granulomatosis.


Wegner's granulomatosis Vs microscopic polyangiitis

Wegener's granulomatosis is associated with c-ANCA, while MPA is associated with p-ANCA.
Granuloma formation occurs in Wegener's granulomatosis, not in MPA.
Lung cavities and nodules are seen in Wegener's granulomatosis, but not in MPA.",Pathology,,1312,3
