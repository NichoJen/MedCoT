A month ago, she had pneumonia with Streptococcus pneumoniae cultured from her sputum. On physical examination, she has a body mass index of 35. A random blood glucose value is 132 mg/dL. The next day, fasting blood glucose is 120 mg/dL, followed by a value of 122 mg/ dL on the following day. She is given an oral glucose tolerance test, and her blood glucose is 240 mg/dL 2 hours after receiving the standard 75-g glucose dose. On the basis of these findings, she is prescribed an oral thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug. After 2 months of therapy, her fasting blood glucose is 90 mg/ dL. The beneficial effect of TZD in this patient is most likely related to which of the following processes?",Activation of PPARg nuclear receptor in adipocytes,Decreased production of insulin autoantibodies,Greater density of insulin receptors in adipocytes,Increased half-life of circulating plasma insulin,0,single,"The clinical features of obesity with angina and glucose intolerance in this patient strongly suggest type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is confirmed by the oral glucose tolerance test (>200 mg/dL at 2 hours), useful in this case because her fasting blood glucose levels of 120 mg/dL and 122 mg/dL did not quite reach the diagnostic criterion of 126 mg/dL. The fundamental abnormality in type 2 diabetes mellitus is insulin resistance. Several adipocyte-derived molecules, such as adiponectin and resistin, have been implicated in the causation of insulin resistance, establishing the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg) has emerged as a key molecule in the regulation of insulin resistance through its actions on adipocyte hormones. TZDs bind to and activate PPARg in adipocytes, and increase the levels of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin and reduce the levels of free fatty acids and resistin, both of which increase insulin resistance. Insulin autoantibodies are seen with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Beta-cell loss and density of insulin receptors are not major factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. TZDs do not affect the metabolism of insulin. Glucagon excess worsens diabetes, but TZDs do not affect its secretion. Beta cells do not regenerate, but many antidiabetogenic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus are designed to work with the beta cells that are left.",Pathology,Endocrine,1485,3

How does the normal cells count their divisions i.e. How, do the cells find out that now the), do'nt need to divide fuher. Cells achieve this through telomer shoening Telomers are sho repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosome that are impoant for ensuring complete replication of chromosome ends. It consists of many arrays of TTAGGG repeats at terminal of 3' ending strand. It confers stability to chromosomes. With each successive division there is some shoening of the telomers. Once the telomers are shoened beyond a ceain point the ends of the chromosome are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. The broken DNA leads to activation of p53 dependent cell cycle check points causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis. Thus telomere shoening functions as a clock that counts cell division. How do the germ cells keep on dividing throughout their life ??? In germ cells telomere shoening is prevented by the sustained function of the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomer. It is RNA dependent DNA polymerase. It has one segment that is complimentary to TTAGGG repeat and is used as template for the replication of telomeric sequence. This enzyme is absent from most somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle. Telomerase is present in Germ cells thus explaining the ability of these cells to self replicate extensively. If loss of telomere is the basis of finite life span then how do cancer cells continue to divide actively ???? In cancer cells telomerase activity is reactivated. Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 90% of human tumours.

Morphology

During acute RF, focal inflammatory lesions are found in various tissues.
Distinctive lesions occur in the heart, called Aschoff bodies, which consist of foci of lymphocytes (primarily T cells), occasional plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cells (Pathognomonic for RF).
These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to ovoid nuclei in which the chromatin is disposed in a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation ""caterpillar cells""), and may become multinucleated.
During acute RF, diffuse inflammation and Aschoff bodies may be found in any of the three layers of the heart, causing pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis (pancarditis).
Inflammation of the endocardium and the left sided valves typically results in fibrinoid necrosis within the cusps or along the tendinous cords.
Overlying these necrotic foci are small (1 - to 2- mm) vegetations, called verrucae, along the lines of closure.
Subendocardial lesions, perhaps exacerbated by regurgitant jets, may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques, usually in the left atrium.

It is estimated that about 3% of newborns have a major anomaly, defined as an anomaly having either cosmetic or functional significance.Various kinds of errors in morphogenesis are--mal- formations, disruptions, deformations, sequences, and syndromes.MalformationsIt represents primary errors of morphogenesis, in other words there is an intrinsically abnormal developmental process.They are usually multifactorial rather than the result of a single gene or chromosomal defect.Some, such as congenital heart defects and anencephaiy (absence of brain), involve single body systems, whereas in other cases multiple malformations involving many organs may coexist.DisruptionsIt result from secondary destruction of an organ or body region that was previously normal in development; thus, in contrast to malformations, disruptions arise from an extrinsic disturbance in morphogenesis.Understandably, disruptions are not heritable and hence are not associated with risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies.Deformations Robbins 7th/472It like disruptions, also representan extrinsic disturbance of deve/opmentratherthananintrinsicerrorofmorphogenesis.Deformations are common problems, affecting approximately 2% of newborn infants to varying degrees. Fundamental to the pathogenesis of deformations is localized or generalized compression of the growing fetus by abnormal biomechanical forces, leading eventually to a variety of structural abnormalities.The most common underlying factor responsible for deformations is uterine constraint. Between the 35th and 38th weeks of gestation, rapid increase in the size of the fetus outpaces the growth of the uterus, and the relative amount of amniotic fluid (which normally acts as a cushion) also decreases. Thus, even the normal fetus is subjected to some form of uterine constraint.Several factors increase the likelihood of excessive compression of the fetus resulting in deformations. Maternal factors include first pregnancy, small uterus, malformed (bicornuate) uterus, and leiomyomas. Fetal or placental factors include oligohydramnios, multiple fetuses, and abnormal fetal presentation.An example of a deformation is clubfeet (CTEV), often a component of Potter sequenceSequenceIt is a pattern of cascade anomalies. Approximately half the time, congenital anomalies occur singly; in the remaining cases, multiple congenital anomalies are recognized.In some instances, the constellation of anomalies may be explained by a single, localized aberration in organogenesis (malformation, disruption, or deformation) leading to secondary effects in other organs.A good example of a sequence is the oligohydramnios (or Potter) sequenceSyndromeIt is a constellation of congenital anomalies, believed to be pathologically related, that, in contrast to a sequence, cannot be explained on the basis of a single, localized, initiating defect.Syndromes are most often caused by a single etiologic agent, such as a viral infection or specific chromosomal abnormalitv, which simultaneously affects several tissues.Fig. Malformations. Human malformations can range in severity from the incidental to the lethal. Polydactyly (one or more extra digits) and syndactyly (fusion of digits), both of which are illustrated in A, have little functional consequence when they occur in isolation. Similarly, cleft lip (B), with or without associated cleft palate, is compatible with life when it occurs as an isolated anomaly; in the present case, however, this child had an underlying malformation syndrome (trisomy 13) and expired because of severe cardiac defects. The stillbirth illustrated in C represents a severe and essentially lethal malformation, where the midface structures are fused or ill-formed; in a/most all cases, this degree of external dysmorphogenesis is associated with severe internaI anomalies such as maldevelopment of the brain and cardiac defects.",Pathology,Disease of Infancy & Childhood,4218,3

Gene mutationso The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations.o These may of different types depending w'hether it involves complete gene or single base -(a) Point mutationo A single nucleotide base is substituted by a different base.o When a pyrimidine base is substituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine - Transition.o When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa - Transversion.o This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i.e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product.o Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation.o Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in [3-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine.o Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon.o Example is [3-thalassemia in which CAG codon in p-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation.Deletion and insertionso Deletion or insertion of one or two base lead to alterations in the readi ng frame of the DNA strand - frame shift mutation.o If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three ffamshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized.Trinucleotide repeat mutationo Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide.o In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain,o For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG.Chromosome mutationo Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome..Genome mutationo Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e.g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",Pathology,Mendelian Disorders: Single-Gene Defects,2552,3

It can occur by two ways:? 1. Angiogenesis from pre-existing blood vessels The major steps in this process are :? Vasodilatation by NO, and VEGF-induced increased permeability of the pre-existing vessel. Preoteolytic degradation of basement membrane by metalloproteinases (MMPs) and disruption of cellto-cell contact between endothelial cells by plasminogen activator. Migration of endothelial cells towards angiogenic stimulus. Proliferation of endothelial cells, just behind the leading front of migrating cells. Maturation of endothelial cells. Recruitment of periendothelial cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) to form the mature cells. 2. Angiogenesis from endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) EPCs can be recruited from the bone marrow into tissues to initiate angiogenesis. Growth factors involved in the process of angiogenesis VEGF is the most impoant growth factor in adult tissues undergoing angiogenesis. The most impoant receptor for VEGF is VEGFR-2, a tyrosine kinase receptor. VEGF induces the migration of EPCs in the bone marrow, and enhances the proliferation and differentiation of these cells at sites of angiogenesis. FGF 2 can also stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Newly formed vessels are fragile and need to become stabilized, which requires the recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells (periendothelial cells). Angiopoietin 1 and 2 (Ang 1 & 2), PDGF and TGF-/3 paicipate in stabilization process. Remember VEGF transcription is regulated by the transcription factor HIF, which is induced by hypoxia.",Pathology,,1724,3

Which of the following changes would most likely be found in this patient's blood?,Basophilic leukocytosis,Eosinophilic leukocytosis,Lymphocytosis,Monocytosis,1,single,"An increased number of eosinophils (AKA eosinophilia) occurs in association with several conditions, the most frequent of which are immune-mediated diseases (e.g., asthma, hay fever, and pemphigus vulgaris) and parasitic infestations. This is due to an absolute increase in the number of circulating eosinophils, brought about by IL-5, which stimulates differentiation of eosinophilic precursor cells in the bone marrow.Basophilic leukocytosis is a rare event that is sometimes observed in association with chronic myelogenous leukemia. It is not seen in patients with asthma. Lymphocytosis may result from a vast array of conditions, but it is not typical of asthma or other allergic diseases. Lymphocytosis may develop in response to a number of infections (e.g., brucellosis, whooping cough, hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, and tuberculosis) or manifest as pa of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Petechiae measure less than 2 mm in size, purpuric lesions measure 2 mm to 1 cm, and ecchymoses are larger than 1 cm. Erythema and telangiectasis do not involve hemorrhage outside of blood vessels. They can be differentiated from true hemorrhages into the skin by the fact that they blanch if direct pressure is applied to them. True purpura may be caused by hemostatic or nonhemostatic defects. Hemostatic defects are caused by platelet or coagulation abnormalities, while nonhemostatic defects generally involve the blood vessels. These vascular abnormalities can be separated into palpable and nonpalpable purpura. The latter may be caused by excess coicosteroids (Cushing's syndrome), vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), infectious agents, or abnormal connective tissue diseases (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). Causes of palpable purpura include diseases that cause cutaneous vasculitis, such as collagen vascular diseases and Henoch-Schonlein purpura. The latter, also known as anaphylactoid purpura, is a type of hypersensitivity vasculitis found in children. It usually develops 1 to 3 weeks following a streptococcal infection, but it may also occur in relation to allergic food reactions.

The most common causes are immunologically mediated glomerular injury; lesions are characterized by proliferative changes and leukocyte infiltration. Acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis typically occurs after streptococcal infection in children and young adults but may occur following infection with many other organisms; it is caused by deposition of immune complexes, mainly in the subepithelial spaces, with abundant neutrophils and proliferation of glomerular cells. Most affected children recover; the prognosis is worse in adults. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a clinical entity with features of the nephritic syndrome and rapid loss of renal function.

Studies using immunoassay of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for early diagnosis of pregnancy suggest that the percentage of feilized ova lost in the first trimester might be even higher. The great majority of these cases are attributable to chromosomal abnormalities. Chromosomal studies are not routinely performed in such cases, but they are recommended when a malformed fetus has been identified or when habitual or recurrent aboions occur. Abruptio placentae, a complication of the third trimester, occurs when the placenta detaches prematurely from its implantation site. Retroplacental hemorrhage develops within the space between placenta and uterine wall, leading to interruption or severe reduction in the blood supply to the fetus. Chorioamnionitis, a complication of the second and third trimesters, results from ascending infections through the vaginal canal. Infection of chorioamniotic membranes may lead to premature rupture of membranes and aboion or premature labor. Placenta pre is a placenta implanted in the lower segment of the uterus. When dilatation of this segment begins in late pregnancy, a placenta pre may cause severe bleeding and lead to premature labor. Ref: Kipps T.J. (2010). Chapter 94.

The term pulmonary abscess describes a local suppurative process within the lung, characterized by necrosis of lung tissues.

Etiology 

Aspiration is the most common cause, factors that portend an increased risk of aspiration include esophageal dysmotility, seizure disorders, and neurological conditions causing bulbar dysfunction.
As an aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions is the most common cause, organisms most commonly causing lung abscess are those normally found in the oral cavity, i.e., Anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, peptococcus species).

Other organisms are S. aureus, Klebsiella, Nocardia and gram-negative bacteria.
Morphology

Pulmonary abscesses due to aspiration are more common on the right side because of the more vertical direction of the right main bronchus.
Most often abscess is single.
The cardinal histologic change in all abscesses is the suppurative destruction of the lung parenchyma within the central area of cavitation.",Pathology,,989,3

Because of their dual blood supply, aerial occlusion of either the hepatic aery or the poal vein rarely results in liver infarcts. However, thrombosis of branches of the hepatic aery may result in a pale (anemic) infarct, or possibly a hemorrhagic infarct due to blood flow from the poal vein. In contrast, occlusion of the poal vein, which may be caused by cirrhosis or malignancy, may result in a wedge-shaped red area called an infarct of Zahn. This is a misnomer, however, since it is not really an infarction but instead is the result of focal sinusoidal congestion. Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome) is associated with polycythemia vera, pregnancy, and oral contraceptives. Clinically, Budd-Chiari syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, ascites, tender hepatomegaly, and hematemesis. Occlusion of the central veins, called venoocclusive disease, may be rarely seen in Jamaican drinkers of alkaloid-containing bush tea, but is much more commonly found following bone marrow transplantation (up to 25% of allogenic marrow transplants).

Bleeding in the gum, gastrointestinal tract, and during oral surgery requires the use of oral antifibrinolytic drugs such as ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) or tranexamic acid to control local hemostasis. The duration of the treatment depending on the clinical indication is 1 week or longer. Tranexamic acid is given at doses of 25 mg/kg three to four times a day. EACA treatment requires a loading dose of 200 mg/kg (maximum of 10 g) followed by 100 mg/Kg per dose (maximum 30 g/d) every 6h.
General considerations regarding the treatment of bleeds in hemophilia include the following: (1) Treatment should begin as soon as possible because symptoms often precede objective evidence of bleeding; because of the superior efficacy of early therapeutic intervention, classic symptoms of bleeding into the joint in a reliable patient, headaches, or automobile or other accidents require prompt replacement and further laboratory investigation, (2) Drugs that hamper platelet function, such as aspirin or aspirin containing drugs, should be avoided; to control pain, drugs such as ibuprofen or propoxyphene are preferred. FVIII and FIX are dosed in units. One unit is defined as the amount of FVIII (100 ng/mL) or FIX (5 μg/mL) in 1 mL of normal plasma. One unit of FVIII per kilogram of body weight increases the plasma level by 2%. One can calculate the dose needed to increase FVIII levels to 100% in a 70-kg severe hemophilia patient (<1%) using the simple formula below. Thus, 3500 units of FVIII will raise the circulating level to 100%.
FVIII dose (IU) = Target FVIII levels – FVIII baseline levels x Body weight (kg) x 0.5 unit/kg.
The doses for FIX replacement are different from those for FVIII, because FIX recover after infusion is usually only 50% of the predicted value. Therefore, the formula for FIX replacement is as follows:
FIX dose (IU) = Target FIX levels – FIX baseline levels x Body weight (Kg) x 1 unit/Kg.
The FVIII half-life of 8-12 h requires injections twice a day to maintain therapeutic levels, whereas the FIX half-life is longer, 24 h, so that once-a-day injection is sufficient. In specific situations such as after surgery, continuous infusion of factor may be desirable because of its safety in achieving sustained factor levels at a lower total cost. Cryoprecipitate is enriched with FVIII protein (each bag contains 80 IU of FVIII) and was commonly used for the treatment of hemophilia A decades ago; it is still in use in some developing countries, but because of the risk of bloodborne diseases, this product should be avoided in hemophilia patients when factor concentrates are available.

The same reactions are the underlying basis for several diseases. Contact dermatitis is an example of tissue injury resulting from T cell-mediated inflammation. It is evoked by contact with pentadecylcatechol (also known as urushiol, the active component of poison ivy and poison oak, which probably becomes antigenic by binding to a host protein). On reexposure of a previously exposed person to the plants, sensitized TH1 CD4+ cells accumulate in the dermis and migrate toward the antigen within the epidermis. Here they release cytokines that damage kera- tinocytes, causing separation of these cells and formation of an intraepidermal vesicle, and inflammation manifested as a vesicular dermatitis. It has long been thought that several systemic diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and mul- tiple sclerosis, are caused by TH1 and TH17 reactions against self antigens, and Crohn disease may be caused by uncon- trolled reactions involving the same T cells but directed against intestinal bacteria. T cell-mediated inflammation also plays a role in the rejection of transplants, described later in the chapter. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 118",Pathology,General pathology,1509,3
